ToTheStarsRemake
============

This mod is a remake of [ToTheStars](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tothestars), incorporating [HaveASolTime](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/haveasoltime) and enabling you to use [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter) 8.0 or higher to be compatible with [More Planets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/more-planets-gc-addon) in the new version (versions below 8.0 will crash, whereas the original mod would crash on versions 8.0 and above).
This is a patch that enables stars to be associated with worlds. In other words, you can travel to stars. This version includes a Sun template, which is in line with [HaveASolTime](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/haveasoltime), and other stars must be added manually.
The API provided by this mod may not be utilized by mods developed based on the original ToTheStars mod. If there is a need to utilize it, please append 'remake' to all occurrences of 'tothestars' in the source code and recompile the mod.
